## Personal
Writing and poetry have always been my way of expressing ideas and emotions, offering a creative outlet that connects me with the world in unique ways. I'm deeply passionate about sustainability and driving sustainable business development, focusing on innovative solutions that create lasting impact. Open-source advocacy and Linux hold a special place in my journey, reflecting my belief in collaboration and transparency to inspire growth and innovation.

Art, especially music, enriches my life, as do exploring new perspectives and fostering creativity in everything I do. Toward the end of a fulfilling day, I find balance through martial arts like kickboxing and Muay Thai, outdoor activities, and immersing myself in nature. These pursuits keep me grounded, resilient, and ready for the challenges and opportunities ahead.
