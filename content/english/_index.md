# About Me
Hi, I’m Alireza, a curious mind passionate about creating, building, and making things better. With over a decade of experience in business development and construction management, I’ve spent my career blending creativity, strategy, and technical expertise to bring impactful ideas to life.

I’m deeply invested in sustainable development and innovation, whether it’s crafting a business model that makes a difference, leading a team through a complex project, or brainstorming the next big idea over coffee. My journey has taken me from translating books on entrepreneurial marketing to managing large-scale construction projects and launching events that connect people and ideas.

When I’m not working, you’ll probably find me exploring creative outlets like poetry, storytelling, or even a deep dive into Linux tinkering. If there’s one thing I believe in, it’s that growth happens when we challenge ourselves—and I’m always up for the challenge.

Let’s connect, collaborate, or just have a good conversation about sustainability, business, or life.
